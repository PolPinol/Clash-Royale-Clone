# Clash-Royale-Clone

In this project we have created a version of the popular game Clash Royale. The total set of the program consists of a total of 7 screens.
The program consists of a welcome screen, login, registration again participant, menu with game options, ranking with option to play games
other users, own game history, and finally the game screen.

When starting the program we enter the welcome panel, followed by this is the login panel with the option to register a new user (in the case of login
the menu is accessed, while if a new participant is registered it is returned to the panel login), once logged in we will end up in the menu, where we are
with three options (play game, view ranking or go to our history of games).

At all times in the program we have a configuration button that allows us to exit the program or delete the game. In some panels (ranking and history) we also have
the option to return to the main menu so you don't have to be logging in all the time, in the case of the game you can only return to the menu when the game ends, if you want to leave earlier
a "logout" is made.

The game consists of a board of 7 columns and 10 rows, where each square of the board we have a jPanel. The goal of this is to eliminate all lives of the opponent through
throw some troops that we get by means of coins. The name of coins increases every 2 seconds and each time you kill a troop. Aside from the troops cards and the number of coins, the game consists of a panel
informative with important messages of the game, that can help the user, and another one panel with two graphs showing the number of lives of the same user and the AI, in this way we know at all times the evolution of the game.
